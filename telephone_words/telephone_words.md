Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone number in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of combinations!
<br />
<br />
Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and returns a list of all of the words that can be written on the phone with that number. (You should return all permutations, not only English words.)**
<br />

**Examples:**

<br />
