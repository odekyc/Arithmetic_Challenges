#Even Occurrence
3/4/16 UPDATE: If you solved this challenge previously, you may have to update your function name from evenOccurence (with 1 r) to evenOccurrence (with 2 rs)


Find the first item that occurs an even number of times in an array. Remember to handle multiple even-occurrence items and return the first one. Return null if there are no even-occurrence items.
